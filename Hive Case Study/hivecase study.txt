Your company wants to reward the top 10 users of its website with a Golden Customer plan. Write a query to generate a list of top 10 users who spend the most.
slect  user_id,max(event_code.purchase) from click_stream limit 5;

Note:

To write your queries, please make necessary optimizations, such as selecting the appropriate table format and using partitioned/bucketed tables. You will be awarded marks for enhancing the performance of your queries.
Each question should have one query only.

Use a 2-node EMR cluster with both the master and core nodes as M4.large.

Make sure you terminate the cluster when you are done working with it.

Since EMR can only be terminated and cannot be stopped, always have a copy of your queries in a text editor so that you can copy-paste them every time you launch a new cluster.

Do not leave PuTTY idle for so long. Do some activity like pressing the space bar at regular intervals. If the terminal becomes inactive, you don't have to start a new cluster. You can reconnect to the master node by opening the puTTY terminal again, giving the host address and loading  .ppk key file. 

For your information, if you are using emr-6.x release, certain
